        <section class="content">
          <p>I am Leo Maia, a Design Manager from Brazil with 4+ years of leadership and management experience and 16+ years as a Product Designer living in Amsterdam and working at Booking.com since 2014. I have a bachelor degree in Industrial Design / Visual Communication (2005) and a post-grad in Ergonomics & Human-computer Interaction (2006). Check out <a href="cv/Leonardo_Maia_CV_2022_Jan.pdf">my resume</a>.</p>

          <p>I am really driven towards understanding and solving complex problems using an iterative process comprised of user research, leveraging data insights, diverse forms of exploration, interaction and visual design.</p>

          <p>The creative process is my biggest passion and it's a double win for me whenever I am able to apply any form of creative thinking into my work otherwise I seek to build and create whenever time allows me. That usually means drawing, working on a illustration or making music.</p>
